# Here are some examples of exclude/include matching:
# - *.o" would exclude all names matching *.o
# - /foo" would exclude a file (or directory) named foo in the transfer-root directory
# - foo/" would exclude any directory named foo
# - /foo/*/bar" would exclude any file named bar which is at two levels below a directory named foo in the transfer-root directory
# - /foo/**/bar" would exclude any file named bar two or more levels below a directory named foo in the transfer-root directory
#
# The combination of "+ */", "+ *.c", and "- *" would include all directories and C source files but nothing else (see also the --prune-empty-dirs option)
# The combination of "+ foo/", "+ foo/bar.c", and "- *" would include only the foo directory and foo/bar.c (the foo directory must be explicitly included or it would be excluded by the "*")
#
# NOTES:
# - Rules are RELATIVE to the SOURCE directory
# - The FIRST matching rule is acted on, so consider the order CAREFULLY
# - Watch for trailing `/`: Using it in the END means that the CONTENTS are synched into the destination, not the directory!
# - Check backups for Steam games and the like (https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/vim,linux)
#
# Updated: 27.09.2023 (when backing up to Samsung Portable SSD)
#
# !!! USED PREVIOUSLY TO __MOVE__ HOME - FIX FOR PROPER BACKUP !!!
# - Enable more excludes
# - Exclude security things like SSH keys, etc
# - Check `gitignore.io` for more excludes
#

###  USE `[!]` IN NAME TO EXCLUDE IT  ###
# Disabled the default/normal backup exclude b/c in this case I WANT IT ALL (except... you know)
#- *\[!\]*
#- *\[!B2\]*
- *\(oYo\)*


###  BACKUP FILES, CACHES, TEMPS, ETC  ###

- .DS_Store*/
